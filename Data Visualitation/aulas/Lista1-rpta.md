> **Visualization: Data, Techniques, Applications**

**1.** *Describe, in a paragraph, the distinction between the concepts of Data Visualization and Visual Analytics.*

Mientras que la visualizacion de datos se prioriza la correcta representacion de datos como tales, en la Visualizacion Analitica se prioriza la efectiva representacion de datos, pudiendo obtenerse informacion desde las visualizaciones generadas.

**2.** What is the association between Visualization and Data Science? What is the role of Visualization in that context?

La ciencia de los datos busca procesar, manejar y entender los datos, para subsecuentemente obtener informacion o conclusiones , para este fin ultimo, una correcta visualizacion de datos resulta critico a la hora de tomar de desiciones.

**3.** What is the association between Visualization and Data Mining? Given a particular data set, when do we resort to Visualization? When do we not? When do we resort to Data Mining?
When do we not? What is Visual Data Mining?

4. Draw a comparative table of 5 multidimensional visualization techniques. What are they useful
for? What type of observations do they provide? What is their input? What are the advantages
and disadvantages? What applications could they support?

5. Visualization Task: Suppose you want to produce a visualization that summarizes and helps as a guide to a web-based course. The course is composed by series of linked web pages plus external links and references. Pages can be classes, tasks or additional information. The user must understand the general structure of the course, verify what pages he/she visited and for how long, and quickly find references given for each class. Describe the elements of your visualization and discuss the possible interactive functionalities the user would have in this context. Draw a schema for your visualization. Justify your choices of visual elements. What would change if the visualization were designed to support the teacher in improving the course?

6. Visualization Task: Given the Data set below, draw the parallel coordinates visualization for it. What can you conclude about the data from the visualization? What alternative visualization would you propose for data such as these: (1) if there were up to 1K data points; (2) if there
were over 100K data points.

7. What is the distinction you make between Information Visualization (InfoVis) and Scientific Visualization (SciVis)? Mention two common points and two distinct features between them.

8. What differs InfoVis and SciVis regarding the input formats?

9. What are the main strategies to visualize hierarchies? What distinguishes them? Give an
example of a typical application of each type of visualization you mentioned. Give an example
of a non-native application of hierarchy visualization.

10. Mention and explain three different types of layout for a tree, as well as their advantages and
disadvantages.

11. What are the main strategies for visualizing networks? What are the main applications? What would be the role of centrality measures in these applications? What can be done to improve clutter problems in network visualization? What can be done to support visual analysis of large
networks?

12. What are the main pre-processing steps in text mining/visualization?

13. What is Force-based layout? In what circumstances is the force-based algorithm employed in
visualization?

14. Mention three circumstances in which the use of clustering is benefic in data analysis.

15. Mention two uses for clustering in visualization.

16. What are the most common ways to visualize text collections? Beyond that, what insights are
possible when visualizing text using: multidimensional projections, word trees and similarity
trees?

17. What is (are) the use(s) for a multidimensional projection (MDP)? What is the input for this
type of technique?

18. Mention and explain three different techniques for multidimensional projection, as well as their
advantages and disadvantages.

19. What is the role of data summarization in InfoVis?

20. For the HDR data (homework 1): What alternative visualization would you envisage for that
type of data and what kinds of explorations do you think they would afford?

21. What is (are) the use(s) for a similarity tree? What is the input for this type of technique?
Explain the Neighbor-joining tree. Propose an alternative way to construct a similarity tree.
What do you think the advantages of your proposal would be?

22. Think before answering: What would be a reasonable visualization set up and how would you
use it to explore a data set in order to perform the following tasks:
• image categorization.
• inspection of news in the media in a certain period of time, for the purpose of summarization
of main subjects discussed.
• scientific paper inspection to survey of a particular subject.

23. Think before answering: What would be a reasonable visualization set up to evaluate a set of features extracted from a data set when the purpose is:
• image classification.
• text classification.
• feature selection.

24. Do all the homeworks left on Moodle - USP.
